# Interactive Image Filtering Application on an FPGA

This FPGA-based image processing system and filtering application was built using Nexys Video AMD Artix-7 Board as part of a senior project.

What does it do?

In a nutshell: Stored images are output via HDMI to an external monitor and switches on the board enable users to cycle between different filters (Grayscale, Edge-Detected, Inverse Edge-Detected, etc.)
